# Value Guard

The ValueGuard pattern is a design pattern used for validating method input parameters and ensuring that values assigned to variables 
or properties meet specific criteria. This pattern encapsulates validation logic in a dedicated class, making the code more readable, 
maintainable, and reusable. By using ValueGuard, you can ensure the integrity of data, reduce potential errors, and simplify debugging 
processes. This utility class is particularly useful for enforcing rules and constraints on values, providing a centralized approach 
to validation across different parts of an application.
